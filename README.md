1.	This data demonstrates that charter schools have a higher overall passing rate than district schools. While 94-96% of students in charter schools had math and reading scores above 70, only 73-75% of students in district schools had math and reading scores above 70.
2.	We also see that district schools have more total students and higher total budgets, while charter schools have fewer total students and lower budgets. One would expect the per student budgets to be equal, but district schools have higher per student budgets.
3.	This data would be improved by including information about teachers. That would help answer the question of why district schools have lower overall passing rates compared to charter schools, despite having higher per student budgets. Perhaps the number and quality of teachers could explain this.
4.	The data would also be improved by including budget allocation. What percent of each schoolâ€™s budget goes to teacher salaries, compared to construction, for example? If larger schools have higher total budgets to build more buildings, overall passing rates would not be affected.
